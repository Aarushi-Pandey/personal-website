### Walkthrough

Follow the steps to [Download and Install](#download-and-installation) this repository found above.

#### Changing Text

First we'll want to take a look at `index.html`.

On *lines 9-13* change the `meta` and `title` tags to correspond with your information.

On *line 32* change **Temoc** to your own name. This will change the name in the navigation bar.
![lines-31-32](https://github.com/Mustafa-Sadriwala/acm-swe-workshop/blob/README-update/img/github/31-32.png)

On *lines 73-95* let's take a look at the masthead heading. This area is going to be right below the Temoc avatar.
Replace ***Temoc's Page*** with your full name or a heading you would prefer. Change the description in the `p` tag to match you graduation year and major.

On *lines 116-125* we'll change the About Section. Here there are going to be two columns side by side. You may have to play around a little to make sure you have the right amount of text on both sides. We recommend writing something about your interests, career objectives, and maybe even hobbies.
